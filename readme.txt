Readme file for CS101 Python project.
I'm choosing the mortgage calculator one.
It is simple. I'm concentrating on:
1. The project management aspects.
2. Input, which I haven't used before.
Formula from Wikipedia:
c = rP(1 + r)^N/[(1 + r)^N -1)
Where:
  c is monthly payment
  r is monthly interest (annual / 12)
  N is number of monthly payments (years * 12)
  P is borrowed amount

Test inputs.
Test formula.
Put it all together.
Final tests.
